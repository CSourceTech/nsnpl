Mechanism Of Action
The liver plays an astonishing array of vital functions in the maintenance, performance and regulating homeostasis of the body.
It is involved with almost all the biochemical pathways to growth, fight against disease, nutrient supply, energy provision and reproduction.
And it functions as a centre of metabolism of nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins and lipids and excretion of waste metabolites.
The bile secreted by the liver has, among other things, plays an important role in digestion. Therefore, maintenance of a healthy liver is essential for the overall well being of an individual
Liver is a vital organ playing a major role in metabolism and excretion of xenobiotics from the body.
Liver injury or liver dysfunction is a major health problem that challenges not only health care professionals but also the pharmaceutical industry and drug regulatory agencies.
Liver cell injury caused by various toxic chemicals (certain anti-biotic, chemotherapeutic agents, carbon tetrachloride (CCL4), thioacetamide (TAA) etc.), excessive alcohol consumption and microbes is well-studied.
 

Hepa Detox: Pharmacological evaluation
Efficacy studies: Assessment of liver function & Histopathology
Biochemical parameters i.e., aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamate transpeptidase (GGTP), total bilirubin and total protein, were analyzed according to the reported methods. The liver was removed, morphological changes were observed.
A 10% of liver homogenate was used for antioxidant studies such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST).
A portion of liver was fixed in 10% formalin for histopathological studies.
After draining the blood, liver samples were excised, washed with normal saline and processed separately for histopathological observation. Initially the materials were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for 48 hour and then with bovine solution for 6 hour. Paraffin sections were taken at 5 mm thickness processed in alcohol-xylene series and was stained with alum hematoxylin and eosin. The sections were examined microscopically for histopathology changes.
Statistical analysis
The values were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey multiple comparison tests. P values < 0.05 were considered as significant.
Extensive vascular degenerative changes and centrilobular necrosis in hepatocytes was produced by CCl4. Treatment with different doses of ethanolic extract of Hepadetox produced only mild degenerative changes and absence of centrilobular necrosis, indicating its hepatoprotective efficiency.

 

Hepadetox
It helps is digestion by enhancing metabolic rate thus helps in fat reduction in our body.
As it helps in enhancing metabolic rate it helps in break down of fatty substances thus reducing cholesterol and tri glyceride.
It stimulates hepatic cells in production of glutathione which is essential for the immune system’s proper functioning and is vital in building and repairing tissue. It acts as an important antioxidant, which helps protect your body from damage to cells caused by free radicals.
Indication: Weight & Fat Burner/Anti Oxidant/ Helps improve body complexion
Dosage: 2gm T.I.D

        detailedDescription: `Diabetes as said by IDF is a scourge, slowly engulfing country and entire world. India and entire world has been working round the clock to prevent and treat this dreaded disease which is also called silent killer. American Diabetes Association is working extensively on this issue and is also creating awareness on the same. In global market, even obesity is also considered as disease which comes from the excessive intake of all Junk Food which is deficient of essential fibers & proteins, thus plays a very vital role in propagation of this disease.

Succare is a time tested holistic, comprehensive formulation of 25 ingredients (including Mineral Pitch).Succare with its innovative combination offers synergistic action in controlling Diabetes and the complications associated with it. It not only reduces elevated Blood Sugar level also helps reducing extra fat from the body as it helps pancreas in secretion of vital enzymes.Succare can be called as sure care tonic for Diabetics. Succare is free from Metals.

Succare has been designed to take care all the associated complications of the disease, i.e. excessive appetite, thirstiness, Tendency to put weight, Hypercholesterolemia & Dyslipidemia, Fatty Liver, Retinopathy and Neurological Disease, Hyperacidity, Flatulence, Constipation etc., Innumerous nutritional ingredients have been added in Succare . These nutrients take care of associated deficiency if any and helps patient to control disease and its complications. Supplements added in the product are derived from natural sources and does not cause any side effects. Theses supplements offers additional benefits along with controlling blood sugar levels.

It can be taken along with other anti diabetic medicines (Oral Drugs or Insulin therapies). It may not cause the sudden fall of blood sugar level and is a safe. It shows slow and steady action on Diabetes Mellitus by controlling complications first.`,

        detailedDescription: `Mode of Action
Virulina also, by inhibiting RNA polymerase in COVID 19 viral cells, inhibits the replication of Viral RNA. The anti viral study conducted at Regional Centre of Biotechnolofy clearly concludes that Virulina is a promising candidate for treatment in covid-19 as it has has shown 95.9% inhibition activity visa vis 98.6% of remdesivir on wuhan corona virus strain.VIRULINA in preclinical studies, also enhances the phagocytic efficacy of the PMN cells against infecting microbial cells, thereby stimulating a non-specific immune response.

VIRULINA has shown by preclinical studies, an increase in the early and delayed hypersensitivity reaction to immunogenicity induciers and has a stimulatory effect on chemotaxis dependent leucocyte migration and Proliferation of Lymphocyte, establishing it as an immuno-modulator. VIRULINA in preclinical studies, also enhances the phagocytic efficacy of the PMN cells against infecting microbial cells, thereby stimulating a non-specific immune response.

VIRULINA may alleviate poly(I:C)-induced inflammation by decreasing levels of inflammatory mediators, such as Nitric Oxide, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages and is thus a candidate for modulating virus-hyperinflammation such as a cytokine storm, in COVID 19 infections, and has a significant mucolytic and fibrinolytic activity.`,

        detailedDescription: `Mechanism Of Action
Step 1: Hypercum Stimulates endothelial cells which results in release of NO(Nitric Oxide) Gas.

Step 2: NO gas released from endothelial cells, diffuses into smooth muscle cells that line small blood vessels.

Step 3: Once inside the smooth muscle cell, NO binds to an enzyme, called guanylate cyclase which esults in activation of guanylate cyclase.

Step 4: Guanylate cyclase being activated cleaves two phosphate groups from another compound called guanosine triphosphate . Which results in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

Step 5: This cyclic guanosine monophosphate is responsible for phosphorylation of proteins,including the smooth muscle contractile protein called myosin.

Step 6: Once phosphorylation takes place, smooth muscle cell protien myosin relaxes, thus resulting in vasodilation of the vessel.`,
